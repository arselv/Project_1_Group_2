Project Title: United States Motor Vehicles Sales and Figures. Domestic vs Import.

Team Members: Arsel Vargas, David Hutchinson, Christine Hemphill, Maninder Bawa

Project Description/Outline: Our project is to determine if Imported cars makers have a better sales history compared to Domestic cars, within the continental United States.

We will compare manufactures that offer similar vehicle classes within similar price ranges, so as to rule out price as a determining factor.

We will examine how vehicle sales have changed over the last 5 years for each manufacturer, along with company growth and market share, as data permits. 

Research Questions to answer:
H0: Domestic vehicle manufactures continue to have a better sales history within the United States.

H1: Imported vehicle manufactures have overtaken the domestic market with better sales within the United States.

Additional questions:
1. Is there a correlation between vehicle sales, company growth and market share. If so, does one have more affect than the other?
2. Are there vehicle sales fluctuations due to they time of year?
